            <h2 id="charName">Marilda Gristhalda</h2>
            <h3 id="subTitle"><em>The Witch's Heir</em></h3>
            <p>In the twilight of a crescent moon, a ritual most foul was set into motion by a coven of hags, deep within the twisted groves of the Forgotten Realms. Their intent was dark—a changeling ritual to replace the firstborn of an unlikely union: a human and an elf, a child destined to bridge two worlds. The hags sought to weave chaos into the fabric of this relationship, planting one of their own in the guise of this half-elf child.</p>
            <p>However, as the ritual neared its completion, a divine entity, moved by the plight of the innocent and the purity of the love between the child's parents, intervened. This celestial force, a guardian of balance and protector of the innocent, sought to redirect the child's fate. Though powerful, the entity was bound by ancient laws that forbade direct interference with such deep magic. It could not fully halt the ritual, but could alter its course.</p>
            <p>In a tragic turn, the child's mother, a gentle elf of the forest, succumbed to the strain of childbirth—a life claimed by the dark energies swirling around the birth. The father, a sturdy and kind-hearted human, was left to mourn, unknowing of the true nature of his daughter's birth. The divine intervention, while saving the child from becoming a vessel of chaos, wove a new destiny for her. She was marked by both the divine and the dark—a beacon of potential change, yet shadowed by a prophecy of doom.</p>
            <p>Named Marilda, she grew at the crossroads of two cultures, embodying the grace and connection to nature of her elven heritage, and the resilience and courage of her human lineage. Yet, beneath the surface, Marilda was different. Strange occurrences and inexplicable abilities manifested as she grew, hints of the dark ritual that heralded her arrival into the world.</p>
            <p>On her fifteenth birthday, the truth of her origin was revealed. A mystic, sensing the tangle of fates around Marilda, unveiled the grim prophecy: by her twentieth year, she must confront and defeat the hag who sought to claim her, or be bound to the coven, her will enslaved to their malevolent whims. This revelation shattered her world, casting her path in a new light. The divine intervention that had altered her fate granted her a beacon of hope in the darkness that sought to claim her.
            </p>
            <p>Marilda set forth, driven by a desire to forge her own destiny, to protect the world she loved from the chaos that sought to engulf it. Her journey was to be one of self-discovery, as she sought to understand the full extent of her powers and the nature of the dark magic that she bore. Allies gathered around her—outcasts and wanderers, each with their own tale of defiance against the darkness.</p>
